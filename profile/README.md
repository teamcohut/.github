### The Carrd for Cohort-Based Learning

> Cohut helps solopreneurs, knowledge creators, and organizations to launch and run impactful small to medium-sized cohort-based learning programs with radical simplicity and affordability.

## Introduction

The cohort-based learning model is exploding. It's more engaging, more effective, and more human than traditional online courses. But the operational headaches are holding it back.

Running a cohort-based program is like herding cats while juggling chainsaws. You've got curriculum to manage, participants to wrangle, deadlines to enforce, and a million tiny administrative tasks that eat away at your time and sanity. It's a logistical nightmare that distracts you from what really matters: delivering an exceptional learning experience.

Thatâ€™s the problem similar platforms like Teachfloor and Disco are addressing. They're building the "everything but the kitchen sink" solutions for companies and creators with big budgets and complex needs.
